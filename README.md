## Project setup

One-time step: run this when you check out the repository for the first time,
or when you get dependency errors later on.

```
$ npm install
```

## Serve the website locally
```
$ npm run serve
```

## Push the changes

Push your changes to the main branch, then also deploy to GitHub Pages:
```
$ ./deploy.sh
```
